        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A delicious Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, made famous by my mother dearest, Rachel. While she is not Italian, she certainly could fool a dinner party of guests</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1x Large White Onion - Finely Chopped</li>
                <li>3x Cloves of Garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>2kg Lean Minced Beef</li>
                <li>28 fl oz Canned Diced Tomato</li>
                <li>20 fl oz All Purpose Tomato Sauce</li>
                <li>4 tbsp Original Pesto</li>
                <li>Jar Sundried Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large saucepan soften onion and garlic in a spot of olive oil</li>
                <li>Add beef and brown off</li>
                <li>Add the 2 tins of tomatoes, salt, pepper and pesto and stir and cover and
                    cook for 40 mins. You can then leave to cool and store in fridge until
                    needed the next day or so.</li>
                <li>Or continue to cook for a further 2-3 hours, stir from time to time, leave
                    the lid tilted the whole time to let out the steam and reduce the sauce.</li>
                <li>15 mins before serving add the whole jar of sundried tomatoes and all of
                    the olive oil if you want (I save this for salad dressing) and add more
                    pesto and pepper according to your own taste.</li>
                <li>Serve on any pasta whilst wearing protective clothing - it's very messy
                    and stains!!</li>
            </ol>
